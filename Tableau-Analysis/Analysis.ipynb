    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Topic Selection:**  \n",
    "  We chose this topic and dataset because it provides a rich source of information with thousands of records capturing various crime types, their locations, spatial features and temporal characteristics. The level of detail within the dataset, (especially the geographical latitude and longitude data) also allowed us to experiment with new visualizations in Tableau we hadn't tried before.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  This topic is particularly compelling because crime is a pervasive issue that impacts communities worldwide, influencing public safety, economic conditions, and policymaking. By analyzing this dataset, we aimed to generate actionable insights that could assist a wide variety of stakeholders, including law enforcement, policymakers, and community leaders. These insights could support efforts to create safer neighborhoods, allocate resources more effectively, and improve Chicago's overall quality of life\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Questions:**  \n",
    "  1. What are the overall trends in crime types and their occurrences over time?\n",
    "  2. How do crime patterns vary spatially and temporally across different regions or neighborhoods?\n",
    "  3. What are the key factors and trends associated with homicide occurrences, and how do they differ from other types of crimes?  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Members Contribution:**  \n",
    "  - Kyle's tasks included: Visualizations (Seasonal, Homicide), formatting, editing, dashboard creation and written report writing. Work was split evenly across the team.\n",

    "# Description of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source:\n",
    "The original dataset can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data) at the Chicago Data Portal. Before our EDA, the original dataset contained 8.21M rows and 22 columns, capturing crime records from 2001 to 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection Process:\n",
    "The data was downloaded from and accessed via [this link](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/data_preview). It contains recorded incidents of crime, including attributes such as type, date, location, and arrest status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary:\n",
    "- **Summary**: The original downloaded version contained 8,199,424 rows with 22 unique columns (bool(2), float64(7), int64(3), object(10)). Highlighted names in this Data dictionary are columns we chose to keep for out analysis.\n",
    "- **ID**: Unique identifier for the record.\n",
    "- **Case Number**: The Chicago Police Department RD Number (Records Division Number), which is unique to the incident.\n",
    "- **`Date`**: Date when the incident occurred. This is sometimes a best estimate.\n",
    "- **Block**: The partially redacted address where the incident occurred, placing it on the same block as the actual address.\n",
    "- **IUCR**: The Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting code. This is directly linked to the Primary Type and Description. See the list of IUCR codes [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/c7ck-438e).\n",
    "- **`Primary Type`**: The primary description of the IUCR code.\n",
    "- **`Description`**: The secondary description of the IUCR code, a subcategory of the primary description.\n",
    "- **`Location Description`**: Description of the location where the incident occurred.\n",
    "- **`Arrest`**: Indicates whether an arrest was made.\n",
    "- **`Domestic`**: Indicates whether the incident was domestic-related as defined by the Illinois Domestic Violence Act.\n",
    "- **Beat**: Indicates the beat where the incident occurred. A beat is the smallest police geographic area – each beat has a dedicated police beat car. Three to five beats make up a police sector, and three sectors make up a police district. The Chicago Police Department has 22 police districts. See the beats [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/aerh-rz74).\n",
    "- **District**: Indicates the police district where the incident occurred. See the districts [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/fthy-xz3r).\n",
    "- **Ward**: The ward (City Council district) where the incident occurred. See the wards [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/sp34-6z76).\n",
    "- **`Community Area`**: Indicates the community area where the incident occurred. Chicago has 77 community areas. See the community areas [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/cauq-8yn6).\n",
    "- **FBI Code**: Indicates the crime classification as outlined in the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). See the Chicago Police Department listing of these classifications [here](https://gis.chicagopolice.org/pages/crime_details).\n",
    "- **X Coordinate**: The x coordinate of the location where the incident occurred in State Plane Illinois East NAD 1983 projection. This location is shifted from the actual location for partial redaction but falls on the same block.\n",
    "- **Y Coordinate**: The y coordinate of the location where the incident occurred in State Plane Illinois East NAD 1983 projection. This location is shifted from the actual location for partial redaction but falls on the same block.\n",
    "- **`Year`**: Year the incident occurred.\n",
    "- **Updated On**: Date and time the record was last updated.\n",
    "- **`Latitude`**: The latitude of the location where the incident occurred. This location is shifted from the actual location for partial redaction but falls on the same block.\n",
    "- **`Longitude`**: The longitude of the location where the incident occurred. This location is shifted from the actual location for partial redaction but falls on the same block.\n",
    "- **Location**: The location where the incident occurred in a format that allows for creation of maps and other geographic operations on this data portal. This location is shifted from the actual location for partial redaction but falls on the same block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noteworthy Features:\n",
    "- This data is open source and free to download, it requires no permissions to access and is downloaded to CSV\n",
    "- We considered the data source to have a high level of credibility, and to be an \"authoritative\" dataset for crime as it resides publicly on the City of Chicago Open Data Portal and is compiled from police reports and updated regularly by the Chicago Police Department\n",
    "- The data is partially redacted for privacy, with block-level precision for addresses\n",

    "# Analysis of Data Quality\n",
    "We downloaded the entire dataset, totaling 1.80GB, to ensure we had a comprehensive source for our data selection and pre-processing. From the outset, our goal was to reduce the dataset to a more manageable size while maintaining its relevance regarding our research questions. This process involved careful consideration of the dataset's completeness, accuracy, and consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The original dataset spans over two decades and includes over 8 million records, providing an extensive and detailed view of crime trends in Chicago.\n",
    "   - To maintain completeness, we focused on retaining data that aligned with our research objectives, such as crime type, date, and geographic location. We excluded columns that were less relevant or redundant, ensuring we preserved key dimensions of the dataset. The columns we dropped include: `ID`, `Case Number`, `Block`, `IUCR`, `Beat`,\n",
    "    `District`, `Ward`, `FBI Code`, `X Coordinate`, `Y Coordinate`, `Updated On`, and `Location`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The dataset is sourced from the Chicago Data Portal, a credible source managed by the city’s government. However, certain fields, such as `Latitude` and `Longitude`, are partially redacted to protect privacy, which introduces a minor margin of error for precise spatial analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - During pre-processing, we checked for inconsistencies such as missing values, unexpected data types, and discrepancies in categorical values.\n",
    "   - We dropped rows with null values in critical columns like `Location Description`, `Community Area`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude` to ensure the final dataset was consistent and ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To focus our analysis, we scoped the final dataset using the following parameters:\n",
    "- **Timeframe**: Limited to the years 2014–2023 to include recent data and visualize the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime patterns.\n",
    "- **Columns Retained**:\n",
    "  - `Date`: To analyze temporal trends in crime.\n",
    "  - `Primary Type`: To study crime categories.\n",
    "  - `Description`: To add context to crime types.\n",
    "  - `Location Description`: To understand where crimes occurred.\n",
    "  - `Arrest`: To examine law enforcement responses.\n",
    "  - `Domestic`: To identify incidents involving domestic violence.\n",
    "  - `Community Area`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude`: To perform spatial analyses.\n",
    "  - `Year`: To filter and analyze data across years.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scoping resulted in a final dataset size of approximately ~266MB, enabling a much more managable experience, while retaining what we felt was the most important features within the data.\n"

    "### Approach and Methodology\n",
    "We knew based on the quality of our dataset that we could focus on multiple areas, especially with the geolocation columns. During the EDA process, we decided early on that we wanted to devote at least a portion of the analysis to homicides within Chicago. The other two questions, involving the overall nature of crimes committed in Chicago and the spatial and temporal trends of those crimes, seemed fitting given the additional column types. Due to the high number of Crime types at 35 we also chose to narrow the focus with most of our visualizations. When using crime type as a visualization we focused on the top ten crimes as a way to narrow the focus and provide cleaner visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we scoped our research questions and cleaned the dataset, our visualization journey began by creating draft visualizations in Python. While we eventually made the executive decision to create a Tableau dashboard, most of our draft visualizations were performed in Python. For the sake of this assignment, we will be providing only our finalized visuals from our dashboard in Tableau.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Crime Analysis\n",
    "Our overall crime analysis began with simple plots in Python to visualize crime types. This dataset contains **35 different \"Primary Types\"** (crime categories). Given the substantial number of categories, we hypothesized that there would be a few dominant crime types and many smaller, less common crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this, we visualized a \"Top 10\" list of crimes shown below. Additionally, we discussed and analyzed nuanced interactions within the dataset, such as:\n",
    "- Arrest rates for different crime categories.\n",
    "- The proportion of domestic versus non-domestic violence.\n",
    "- Potential trends the Seasonality of crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we decided on the below four visualizations to highlight the most interesting interactions within the dataset which showcase the results of our analysis and provide insights into the overall crime landscape in Chicago.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial and Temporal Analysis:\n",
    "For spatial and temporal trends, we wanted to focus our analysis on when and where the most crimes were committed. We also wanted to try and visualize seasonal trends based on stereotypes we had encountered previously involving when the propensity of crime is committed each year. We again chose four visualizations; each one focusing on different subsets of the data to try and provide us with further trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Homicide Analysis:\n",
    "For our homicide analysis we wanted to integrate a visual depiction of the most dangerous areas in Chicago. Additionally, we wanted to visualize the arrest rate of homicide and the location where most homicides take place. We chose three different visualizations for the section, with the highlight being the interactive choropleth map which plots homicides by community area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Tableau Visualization Process:\n",
    "We wanted to add some thematic enhancements to the overall dashboard while also including some reference to the city of Chicago. The image in the dashboard itself is  a shot of some of the skyscrapers in the Chicago skyline. We also chose a bold red on black theme to harken back to the crime \"theme\" them of the dashboard. We tried to keep the color schema the same throughout most of the visualizations, while make some small edits for readability or clarity.\n"

Since the file size was around 2 GB it took almost hours and the visualizations also took time to be responsive and we encountered errors most of the time with \"maximum shelf limit\" reached while displaying crime description or types. File size was reduced as a fix.\n",

    "# Key Findings\n",
    "- SMART Question-1: Overall Crime Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "From the visualisations, we found out that theft was the most frequent crime overall. Even during the covid, theft was the most frequent crime while the others also seeems to be in the same order of frequency. The count of crimes seemed to be decreased but gradual increase in crime count is observed post pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SMART Question-2: Spacial and Temporal Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For spatial and temporal analysis, we noticed common patterns across the entire dataset, with the main takeaways being that crime is mostly committed at night, on the street, in the summer and likely won’t be followed with an arrest. We also visualized season trend crime trends with crime the hotter months host to more crime, and we also noted the drop in overall crime in 2020 and 2021 due to covid. Finally, weekends were host to the most crime, but with only a small uptick in overall percentage compared to the other week days.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smart Question-3: Homicide Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    " Our three visualizations involving homicide generally parallel other crimes within the dataset. We did focus on the Community Area’s and by visualizing homicide within the confines we noticed certain areas had much higher homicide rates than others, especially in Austin and its neighboring areas. Where homicides we committed also showed similar results to other more common crimes, with the propensity being on the streets and in residencies. Arrest rate and seasonality also mirrored typical crime trends, with the arrest rate remaining low and homicide numbers spiking each summer mostly in July and August. Although numbers are lower than say it’s peak in 1992, Chicago remains a dangerous city, leading the nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the key findings from python statistical analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Community Areas*:\n",
    "    - Chicago is broken into **77 Community Areas**, and all are represented in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Crime Descriptions:*\n",
    "  - There are **514 unique descriptions**, reflecting the detailed categorization within each primary crime type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Domestic Incidents*:\n",
    "  - Approximately **19.4% of incidents** (**482,170**) are flagged as domestic.\n",

    "- *Geographic Center (Centroid)*:\n",
    " - The centroid of the dataset is located at **(41.8433, -87.6705)**, which is within Chicago.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Crime Types*:\n",
    "  - **Theft** is the most frequently recorded crime (**558,807 occurrences**), followed by **Battery** (**463,348**) and **Criminal Damage** (**277,154**).\n",
    "  - Rare categories include:\n",
    "    - **Ritualism** (1 occurrence)\n",
    "    - **Human Trafficking** (87 occurrences)\n",

    "- *Crime Locations*:\n",
    "  - Most crimes occur on:\n",
    "    - **Streets** (605,854 occurrences)\n",
    "    - **Residences** (390,166 occurrences)\n",
    "    - **Apartments** (376,918 occurrences)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Arrests*:\n",
    "  - Only **19.2% of crimes** (**478,682**) resulted in an arrest, while **80.8%** (**2,008,306**) did not.\n",

    "## Limitations Encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "We encountered several limitations while working with Tableau to create and share our visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Sharing Challenges**:  \n",
    "   Our initial plan was to use Tableau Cloud to seamlessly build and share the dashboard. Unfortunately, due to account mismatches and login duplications, we were unable to collaborate effectively using the cloud platform. As a result, we resorted to manually sharing Tableau files, which was less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Experience with Tableau**:  \n",
    "   Our limited familiarity with Tableau proved to be another limitation. While pre-made dashboards showcase the polished potential of Tableau, the learning curve for crafting nuanced and effective dashboards is steep. This hindered our ability to fully utilize the tool’s advanced features and create a more refined final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Size of the Original Dataset**:  \n",
    "   The overall size of the original dataset was daunting and was the first challenge we set out to tackle. While it would have been ideal to export a refined CSV directly from Chicago's data portal, we instead performed the necessary transformations in Python to make the dataset manageable for our analysis."

As mentioned previously, this dataset—or ones like it—could be highly relevant to law enforcement, policymakers, and community leaders. Research could be performed to provide actionable insights tailored to these groups. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For Law Enforcement**:\n",
    "   - **Resource Allocation**: Use spatial and temporal crime patterns to optimize patrol routes and allocate police resources more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For Policymakers**:\n",
    "   - **Policy Impact Analysis**: Study the effects of new policies (e.g., gun control measures, community policing) on crime trends.\n",

    "3. **For Community Leaders**:\n",
    "   - **Community Outreach**: Identify neighborhoods with high crime rates to focus on community-building initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **General Research Opportunities**:\n",
    "   - **COVID-19 Impact**: Explore how the pandemic influenced crime trends, particularly in areas like domestic violence or theft."

    "1. **Scoping the Dataset**:  \n",
    "   - In hindsight, we likely would have scoped the dataset even further if we had fully realized how large it was going to be after deciding to analyze 10 years of data. A smaller, more focused dataset might have allowed us to streamline the analysis process and reduce computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Selection**:  \n",
    "   - We initially considered using Python as our final visualization tool. However, after working through this assignment in Jupyter, we realized that a more thorough discussion about the benefits of using Tableau might have been valuable early on.  \n",
    "   - That being said, we are much more proficient with Tableau, and choosing it as our visualization platform ultimately allowed us to present our insights more effectively and efficiently.\n",
